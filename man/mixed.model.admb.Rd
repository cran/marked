\usage{
  mixed.model.admb(formula,data)

  mixed.model(formula,data)

  mixed.model.dat(x,con)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{formula for mixed effect mode in the form
  used in lme4; ~fixed +(re1|g1) +...+(ren|gn)}

  \item{data}{dataframe used to construct the design
  matrices from the formula}

  \item{x}{list structure created by mixed.model.admb}

  \item{con}{connection to data file which contents will be
  appended}
}
\value{
  mixed.model.admb returns a list with elements fixed.dm,
  the design matrix for the fixed effects; re.dm, a
  combined design matrix for all of the random effects; and
  re.indices, matrix of indices into a single vector of
  random effects to be applied to the design matrix
  location. mixed.model returns similar quantities for the
  random effects in a list structure (re.list) except that
  the indices are limited to the particular random effect
  grouping. May be more useful with R than ADMB.

  Functions that develop structures needed for a mixed
  effect model
}
\details{
  mixed.model.admb - creates design matrices and supporting
  index matrices for use of mixed model in ADMB

  mixed.model - creates design matrices and supporting
  index matrices in an alternate list format that is not as
  easily used in ADMB

  mixed.model.dat - writes to data file (con) for fixed and
  random effect stuctures
