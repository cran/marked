\item{time.intervals}{Intervals of time between the capture occasions}

\item{accumulate}{if TRUE, like capture-histories are accumulated to reduce computation}

\value{
dataframe with simulated data
}
\description{
Creates a set of data from a specified HMM model for capture-recapture data.
}
\details{
The specification for the simulation includes a set of data with at least 2 unique ch and freq value to 
specify the number of ch values to simulate that start at the specified occasion. For example, 
1000 50
0100 50
0010 50
would simulate 150 capture histories with 50 starting at each of occasions 1 2 and 3. The data can also 
contain other fields used to generate the model probabilities and each row can have freq=1 to use individual
covariates. Either a dataframe (data) is provided and it is processed and the design data list are created
or the processed dataframe and design data list are provided. Formula for the model parameters for generating 
the data are provided in model.parameters and parameter values are provided in initial.

# define simulation/fitting model; default for non-specified parameters is ~1
# but all are listed here. For the formula for Psi, the -1 is necessary to remove
# the intercept which is not needed and would be redundant. 
# The formula '~ -1 + stratum:tostratum' is often appropriate for multi-state
# transitions as it allows different values for Psi depending on 
# the current state (state at time t) and the new state (state at t+1). 
modelspec <- list(
	S = list(formula = ~ -1 + stratum),
	# by presenting the formula for S as '~-1+stratum', it is possible to

	# scenario where survival varies by stratum but no other covariates

#  beta values used to set probabilities for various transitions)

			log(0.2/0.5), log(0.2/0.6)))  # Psi(AC) & Psi(BC)
# The desired probabilties for the transition matrix for Psi are as follows
#        To:
# From:    A   B    C
#    A   .5   .3   .2
#    B   .2   .6   .2
#    C   .3   .6   .4
# The values in the list above are obtained using the transitions AA, BB, CC
#  as reference values in the denominator of log-odds calculations. 
# For example, to achieve the desired probabilities for the transition 
#  from A to B use log(0.3/0.5) and from A to C use log(0.2/0.5)
# exp(log(0.3/0.5))/(1 + exp(log(0.3/0.5)) + exp(log(0.2/0.5))) = 0.3
# exp(log(0.2/0.5))/(1 + exp(log(0.3/0.5)) + exp(log(0.2/0.5))) = 0.2
# Note:           1/(1 + exp(log(0.3/0.5)) + exp(log(0.2/0.5))) = 0.5

# call simmHMM to get a single realization

# it is only the simulation that requires specification as an HMM.
