\title{Likelihood function for Jolly-Seber model using Schwarz-Arnason POPAN
formulation}
\usage{
js.lnl(par, model_data, debug = FALSE, nobstot, jsenv)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{vector of parameter values}

\item{model_data}{a list that contains: 1)imat-list of vectors and matrices constructed by
\code{\link{process.ch}} from the capture history data, 2)Phi.dm design matrix for Phi constructed by \code{\link{create.dm}},
3)p.dm design matrix for p constructed by \code{\link{create.dm}}, 4)pent.dm design matrix for probability of entry constructed by \code{\link{create.dm}},
5) N.dm design matrix for estimates of number of animals not caught from
super-population constructed by \code{\link{create.dm}},
6)Phi.fixed matrix with 3 columns: ch number(i), occasion number(j),
fixed value(f) to fix phi(i,j)=f, 7) p.fixed matrix with 3 columns: ch number(i), occasion number(j), 
8) pent.fixed matrix with 3 columns: ch number(i), occasion number(j), fixed value(f) to fix pent(i,j)=f, and
9) time.intervals intervals of time between occasions if not all 1
fixed value(f) to fix p(i,j)=f}

\item{debug}{if TRUE will printout values of \code{par} and function value}

\item{nobstot}{number of unique caught at least once by group if applicable}

\item{jsenv}{environment for js to update iteration counter}
}
\value{
-log likelihood value, excluding data (ui) factorials which are added in js after optimization to match MARK
}
\description{
For a given set of parameters and data, it computes -2*log Likelihood value
but does not include data factorials. Factorials for unmarked are not needed
but are included in final result by \code{\link{js}} so the result matches
output from MARK for the POPAN model.
}
\details{
This functions uses \code{\link{cjs.lnl}} and then supplements with the
remaining calculations to compute the likelihood for the POPAN formulation
(Arnason and Schwarz 1996) of the Jolly-Seber model.
