\usage{
R_HMMLikelihood(x,first,m,T,dmat,gamma,delta)
       loglikelihood(object,ddl=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{single observed sequence (capture history)}

\item{first}{occasion to initiate likelihood calculation for sequence}

\item{m}{number of states}

\item{T}{number of occasions; sequence length}

\item{dmat}{observation probability matrices}

\item{gamma}{transition matrices}

\item{delta}{initial distribution}

\item{object}{fitted hmm model}

\item{ddl}{design data list; will be computed if NULL}
}
\value{
both return log-likelihood, alpha, v and phi arrays
}
\description{
R implementation of HMMs described in processed report except function HMMLikelihood renamed to R_HMMLikelihood and changed to compute
values for all capture histories and return  lnl, alpha, phi, v, dmat, and gamma values. loglikelihood is called with a fitted hmm model
and then computes the gamma,dmat and delta matrices and calls R_HMMLikelihood function. These are not used by the fitting code.
