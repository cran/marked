marked 1.0.9 24 Jan 2013
------------

CHANGES

* modified iteration counter so it was stored in an environment rather than in global workspace to meet CRAN policy


marked 1.0.8 23 Jan 2013
------------

NEW FEATURES

* added multi-state model with fixed effects using admb. This is done with new function mscjs and multistate.tpl. 
It required changes to create.dm,create.dmdf, crm, process.ch and process.data. The code is functional but currently only 
returns admb object that will not work with other generic functions, so crm will not allow it currently.


marked 1.0.7 14 Dec 2012)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* added use of admb and random effects for CJS. Controlled through arguments use.admb=TRUE and re=TRUE respectively. Doesn't currently work with predict.

BUG FIXES

* fixed problem in create.dmdf which was removing id field if fields (static) specified

* made change to cjs.f which was incorrectly fixed for loss on capture

* made changes to bayesCR.cpp to remove compilation warnings


marked 1.0.6 (5 Oct 2012)
------------
CHANGES

* removed autoscale feature which complicated code and was not very effective

* Removed simulation code and put in a separate package - simcr.

* restructured the model object that is returned from crm

NEW FEATURES

* Function load.model will return externally stored model. Most useful with crm.wrapper and external=TRUE 

* Generic function predict will provide estimates of real parameters and optionally std errors, conf intervals and vcv matrix for the existing or newdata. Does not handle fixed parameters at present.

* crm.wrapper now returns a list like mark.wrapper in RMark with a model.table.  The model list elements are the filenames of the externally saved model results. A default print method is included to print out model selection table. Also, an external argument was added.

* Modified cjs.initial to use either logit or probit and added initial value calculation to probitCJS 

* Allows initial=value and all parameters given that initial value

* Can now handle specification of more than one method for optimization within optimx; setting control=list(follow.on=TRUE) in the arguments will let it use par estimates as starting values as it proceeds through list of methods.

* Added SANN as a stand alone method with optim. Default of itnmax should be increased substantially for this method.

* Modified cjs.initial to use freq as weight in glm to properly weight estimation when freq>1.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug in js.lnl which was not getting lnl correct when there were no groups; cosmetic and did not affect estimates because was constant part (ui)

* Fixed bug in which accumulate argument was not passed to process.data from crm  


marked 1.0.5 (12 July 2012)
------------
NEW FEATURES

* Simplified code in cjs.f but no obvious payoff in speed. Set p=1e-307 if p=0 and freq>0 to avoid log(0) issue. This is close to value used in MARK.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug in hessian calculation which was using 2*lnl instead of lnl


marked 1.0.4 (6 July 2012)
------------
NEW FEATURES

* js is now structured the same as cjs and includes all features.

* integrated probitCJS into crm.

* Added automatic data accumulation and creation of freq field where all data fields are the same. See argument accumulate in crm.

* added autoscaling of parameters; see autoscale argument

* added simcjs and simpopan and related functions for simulating data for cjs and js models

marked 1.0.3 (4 October 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Code was modularized to make package easier to extend. js is now structured the same as cjs.

* If time.interval is a field in the Phi design data it will be used as Phi^time.interval.  This allows variation in time intervals across animals as with cohorts of pups branded at different times each year.

* Added probitCJS model and accompanying code.


BUG FIXES

* Change made in cjs.accumulate to compare accumulated frequencies to sum of data frequencies. Previously was using number of rows and would fail if any freq>1.

marked 1.0.2 (30 March 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added check on accumulator to report error if sum of frequencies does not match original number of records.

* Added model convergence check and reporting of model convergence message, if non-null.

* Added function fix.parameters to create matrix needed for fixing real parameters 

* Added option to include remove.intercept=TRUE in model.parameters list for each parameter to force removal of intercept. 

* Added refit argument to crm, cjs and js to control number of refittings if model doesn't converge.

* Added function create.links which works out which real parameters can use a sin link.  Code was added to cjs and cjs.lnl to use the sin link where appropriate.  This is commented out at present!  Not sure it is working correctly.

* Uses optimx function for optimization which allows more methods and multiple methods to be selected.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed issue with capture history accumulator when chunk_size was larger than needed. Added 1 to pieces.

* Beta estimate names were lost once sparse matrices were implemented and this was fixed.

* Made change to accumulation code to correct error introduced in last version with fixed parameters.

* Made fixes to js to accommodate accumulation. 
  
marked 1.0.1 (22 March 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added use of sparse matrices for design matrices which sped up code and reduced memory consumption. The argument chunk_size was added to crm, create.dm,cjs, and js to control amount of memory usage.

* Added run timing and various print statements to track progress of model.  If debug=FALSE, includes function evaluation counter (every 100) and neg lnl which remains on same line unless used in Rterm.

marked 1.0.0 (Initial posting 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Extracted crm and accompanying code from RMark and created initial base package.
